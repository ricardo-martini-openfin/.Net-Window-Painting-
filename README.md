# .Net-Window-Painting

# How it works:

Created a Simple App that hides and shows an Embbeded view and navigates to a location.

# Technology used:

This is leveraging openfinDesktop v 7.1.0

Tried on OpenFin Runtime v20.91.63.5, v19.89.61.8, and v18.87.57.42

# Conclusion:
Ricardo D has provided a work around. If not, we could potentially fix the Adapter
